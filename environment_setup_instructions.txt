# Overview

To set up a python environment which will allow you to run genetic wing 
optimizations, you will need to configure your python environment to a few 
specific requirements. For the purpose of this tutorial I will be using Anaconda
as my package manager, though virtual environments should also work here. I have
also only tested this with Windows 64-bit. 

# Instructions: 

1.  create a new conda environment which uses Python 3.9.XX. The AVL API will 
    not work with another version.  

2.  Go to OpenVSP's download page (https://openvsp.org/download.php) and download
    OpenVSP 64-bit Python 3.9 (I have been using version 3.34.0).

3.  extract the contents of the downloaded .zip folder and put them somewhere safe. I 
    put mine in C:/Program Files

4.  Open anaconda prompt and change your directory to ...\OpenVSP-3.33.1-win64\python
    using the "cd" command. Make sure the correct environment is activated. 

5.  run the setup.ps1 by entering 
    powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup.ps1
    wait for the process to finish. avlpy should now be in your packages/modules list 

5.  The file avlInput.py located at ...\OpenVSP-3.33.1-win64\python\AvlPy\avlpy
    is missing some modifications I've made. Replace it with the avlInput.py found 
    in .zip folder: avl_and_xfoil.zip.

6.  From the unzipped folder, get avl.exe or download it from the official website.
    Create a folder called "bin" in the directory: ...\OpenVSP-3.33.1-win64\python\AvlPy\avlpy
    and place avl.exe inside of it. 

9.  Get xfoil.exe from the unzipped folder, or download a copy from the official website,
    and place xfoil.exe inside this repository alongside wing_optimization_study.py

10. finally, make sure you have the standard packages in your environment: 
    matplotlib, numpy, pickle, subprocess, multiprocessing. You may have to conda/pip install 
    some of these if they're not in your environment already
